<h2>Intro</h2>
I've used HTML to create a website that contains a blog and about page.<br>
Jekyll is being used to link different pages to the default page.
<h2>Blog</h2>
It has a for loop that looks in the posts folder and checks the content and assings it to the specific date.
<h2>About</h2>
This page contain some information about myself and has some images.
